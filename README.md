This is A horror exploration game set in the Backrooms, where you must search each level for Notes to progress.
The game features five increasingly large levels, each revealing its own piece of the story. 
As you explore, a hostile entity stalks the maze, relentlessly hunting you and trying to stop your escape.
You can flash it with your flashlight to drive it away, but your flashlight doesn't last forever.
